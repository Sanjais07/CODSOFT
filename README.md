# **Artificial Intelligence Project**

This repository contains the implementation of various Artificial Intelligence tasks. Each task explores a specific domain of AI, showcasing concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Game Theory, Computer Vision, and Recommendation Systems.

---

## **Project Overview**

This project includes the following tasks:

1. **Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses**: Simulates basic conversation using predefined rules.
2. **Tic-Tac-Toe AI**: Implements an unbeatable AI for the classic game using the Minimax algorithm.
3. **Image Captioning**: Combines computer vision and NLP to generate captions for images.
4. **Recommendation System**: Suggests items to users based on their preferences using collaborative filtering.
5. **Face Detection and Recognition**: Detects and recognizes faces in images or video streams.

Each task demonstrates a fundamental AI concept and is implemented in Python.
